# web-scraper
Scrape data from race result web pages rendered in JavaScript

### Purpose
This repo is to develop code that will allow for scraping of race results data from websites such as the [Leadville 100](https://results.chronotrack.com/event/results/event/event-17330?_ga=1.26297597.1545639595.1484896783). Results pages that are rendered using `JavaScript` are somewhat more complex than a simple `html` page.
